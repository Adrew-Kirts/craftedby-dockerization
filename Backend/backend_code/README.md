## Authentication

To authenticate with the API, you can send a POST request to the `/api/login` endpoint with the `email` and `password` parameters in the request body. 

The response will contain a JSON object with the `token` field, which is the API token for the authenticated user.

Example response body:
``` 
{
    "message": "Login successful",
    "token": "9b2cf968-f6f0-4846-9887-a3743718a7da|I5DzbQP9Bus8DT8TmWeFc5gHrlu7y9nr4vWrjXif42ea2383"
}
```

## Using API token

In the case of wanting to use a protected rout where a regular_user can only view its own user data;

E.g. `GET /api/users/{id}`: Returns the details of a specific user.
 
The API token (Bearer token) should be sent with the request.

## Error Handling

If an error occurs while processing a request, the API will return a JSON object with an `error` field and a `message` field. The `error` field will be set to `true` if an error occurred, and `false` otherwise. The `message` field will contain a description of the error.
